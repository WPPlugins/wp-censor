<!--description-->
Allows the ability to hide explicit contentÂ allow the user to choose if they wish to view it.

Censor gives you two forms of censorship:

<strong>1. Hide and Reveal</strong>

By wrapping a phrase in either [censor][/censor] bbCode tags you will block out the phrase, but give the user the option to reveal the hidden phrase by moving over the phase with the mouse.

<strong>2. Automatic Predefined</strong>

On the `Settings-&gt;Censor` admin page you can build a list of phrases you wish to censor.

Censor will match the phrases to be replaced to whole words and you will not have the problem of an accidental match inside a word, making nonsense of the post.

Also for added safety Censor will ignore any HTML or BBCode tags in the post, replacing only their inner content and not messing around with their attributes.
To allow for the possibility that you may add phrases that overlap, you can prioritise the phases.

As Censor filters the content each time the post is requested, It is recommended that you consider installing a page caching plugin.
